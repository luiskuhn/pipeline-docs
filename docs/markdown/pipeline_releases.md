# Pipeline releases

Below is a list of the pipeline releases that should be used at QBiC for the analysis.
Unless a release has a bug that makes it impossible to work with your data, please use this fixed releases.
These versions will be revised periodically and tested in our infrastructure before update.

## Routine params to trigger most common pipelines

For our Slurm cluster, we use the profile `cfc` that is stored under [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/conf/cfc.config).

If you want to test the pipelines in your system, you can use `-profile test,docker` or `-profile test,singularity` if you have docker or singularity installed. Note that the params files will need to be edited to your input data.

### Sarek variant calling

To run pipeline tests use the following command:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/sarek -r 2.7 -profile test,cfc
```

To launch sarek for germline WGS using the [example params](https://github.com/qbic-pipelines/pipeline-docs/blob/master/docs/params/sarek_WGS_germline.json) use the following command:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/sarek -r 2.7 -profile cfc -params-file sarek_WGS_germline.json
```

To launch sarek for somatic WES / WXS using the [example params](https://github.com/qbic-pipelines/pipeline-docs/blob/master/docs/params/sarek_WXS_somatic.json) use the following command:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/sarek -r 2.7 -profile cfc -params-file sarek_WXS_somatic.json
```

### RNAseq analysis

To run pipeline tests we use the following command:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 1.4.2 -profile test,cfc
```

To launch rnaseq for RNAseq using our [example params](https://github.com/qbic-pipelines/pipeline-docs/blob/master/docs/params/rnaseq.json) use the following command:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 1.4.2 -profile cfc -params-file rnaseq.json
```
